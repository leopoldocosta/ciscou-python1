Key observations regarding Python:
Integers cannot use comma while being represented.Or assign it to a variable.But you can use under score to make it more human readable.And represented in the code.Since the IDE, we remove those underscores when running.

Float numbers cannot be represented when printed by Python with more than 17 characters. If the Variable float has more than 17 characters, it will be printed only 17 or it will be represented in exponential notation (e), like 1e7, one to the power of 7.

While using lists in Python, you can access the last item of the list using a negative -1 to access it.This is a Python function that you can use throughout your code to access a list item. Instead of having to know their position, you just use a negative number.To access it from the end to the beginning.

Append method adds the item to the list to the end of it and the insert method adds the item to the list where you set it to be inserted by using the index number where you want it to be inserted.

In a list, the pop method will remove the Item of the list if you don't set an index to which you want to be removing it. If you set an index number, then you remove the list item from the index you set on the pop method.One thing about pop method is that you can use it to.A sign of item removed from a list to another variable since it prints or returns the item it removed. 

Notes:
As a Python developer, it is important to understand how to interact with Python in.Interpreter as well as how to execute Python files.

Read Evaluate print loop REPL

Variable is a name container. 

Python code style to verify style and PEP 8 structure convention for other elements.

Remove method will only remove the first item in the list that matches the entry you defined in the method calling.

Count method can count the number of entries in a list that matches the entry you passed into when calling this method.

Lists use brackets
Sets use curly/angled brackets (unordered, but no duplicates)
Tuples use parenthesis
Dictionaries also use curly brackets, but work in key:value pairs separated by comma

In dictionaries you can access an item.Instead of using a number index to use the key as an index to access the value of that key.

Dictionary methods: get(), items(), keys(), values(), clear(), pop(), update(),
